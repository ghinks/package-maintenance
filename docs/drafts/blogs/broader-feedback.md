# Broader Feedback Blog Post

## Background
It is widely accepted that the Javascript community now has a sustainability issue. The number of package
dependencies within the ecosystem is large. Many important packages are struggling with support issues. It 
is recognized that events in the live's of many maintainers can lead to important packages going without 
the necessary support they need.

The [package maintenance team](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance) has been formed to address these issues. The team meet bi-weekly as one of the many node committees with meetings recorded on [you tube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfMzBWSH11xYuROYr6Z9TpS0Wb9lRIldn). 
The committee falls under the supervision of the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

This group seeks to provide a framework to offer support to key packages within the ecosystem that may need
assistance with maintenance. The package maintenance group is offering guidelines covering many aspects of 
package support and publishing. These include but are not limited to:

- versioning
- licensing
- tooling (@eomm)
- support levels
- backing
- soliciting help
- publishing best practices

### For Package Maintainers

If you are maintaining a significant package and require assistance the package maintenance team may be able to
assist your project. 

### For Package Consumers
The package maintenance team seeks to provide clear guidelines for the level of support that a package can expect
to receive from its maintainers. The team are offering guidance upon licensing and funding so that consumers can have 
baseline expectations about the package. 

## Ongoing Discussions

- Support file format JSON or MD ?
- Support json in package.json or not
- external reference or within package


## Call to action
Within the community as a whole we have now recognized that the package ecosystem has 
reached a level of maturity that requires guidelines. Whether a maintainer can no longer 
commit to support an essential package or if the maintainers can no longer commit to 
supporting older versions or engines for a package. 

We need an agreement that serves both the maintainers and the consumers of packages. The
agreements may cover [financial commitments](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/187382017885/supporting-open-source-maintainers)
or may be a commitment to follow the guidelines presented by the [package maintenance team](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance).
